# BabysitterKata
Swift 4.0 Solution for Babysitter Kata

This repository is not a strict TDD Kata but an example of a working solution for the babysitter to calculate what to charge for a night of babysitting. Included is a non-working UI to show one way it could be presented. The example includes a Swift playground with the development process used in creating the app. There are classes, extensions, tests, and storyboards. To use the code open the playground and RUN it. The amount the babysitter will charge is printed in the console. The startTime, bedTime, and endTime can be modified by changing the string values at the bottom of the script. Pay careful attention when changing these values that you use the right date when you move past midnight. 

To see how the playground code translates into a working app, locate the classes:
-- Utility.swift
-- BabysitterViewController.swift

The UI can be found in the Main.storyboard (naturally). To see the UIButton extension, locate the class:
-- BabysitterButton.swift

To run the Unit Tests, locate:
-- BabysitterTests.swift

The font is included in the project for the UI.
